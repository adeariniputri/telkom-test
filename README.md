# Telkomsel Machine Learning Engineer Associate Test

Dataset from Kaggle from user DEBADRI DUTTA which was updated five years ago. 
The data contains images with classification: Art & Culture, Architecture, Food and Drinks, Travel and Adventure. 
Three folders contain images (which are used for training the dataset), tests, and validation. Each folder has the four categories mentioned above.

Method that are used :
Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a multilayer neural network. 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were created to handle picture data more effectively and efficiently. 
The ability of convolutional layers to process various portions of the input picture using the same weights is known as parameter sharing. 
As the kernel traverses over the image, this helps to identify feature patterns that are translation invariant. 
This method increases the model efficiency by drastically lowering the overall number of trainable parameters when compared to fully linked layers.
